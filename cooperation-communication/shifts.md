## Shift Attendance & Coverage:

The scheduler is *not responsible* for finding you shift replacements.

The scheduler *is* responsible for initial scheduling, moving shifts, coordinating leaves of absence, and other misc. bits and pieces of general assistance.

You are responsible for finding shift replacements, by talking to other members and using co-op resources.<br />If you do not work for a week, you should not take your discount that week.

Asking a member who works an overlapping shift to "cover" for you, is *not* equivalent to finding someone to come in and work your shift. (if you work 4- 6:15, the 5:00 person can't cover- the 2PM or 6PM person could).

## Finding Coverage

1. Find a replacement. Many members organize shift trades:

	A) Via the co-op mailing lists: See our [list help page](http://lips.github.io/picnic/cooperation-communication/email-lists/) for instructions on how to join the lists.<br />You're more likely to find coverage if you include all the important information in the subject, like so:

	<blockquote>Subject: Coverage needed, Wed 12/15, 1-3:15pm
</blockquote>

	B) Use the co-op member directory ([PDF version](http://4thstreetfoodcoop.org/twiki/pub/Members/WebHome/CurrentCoopDirectory.pdf)), also found in the store) to contact other members directly. It can be helpful to contact people that work the at same time as you do on other days of the week, or the person scheduled to come in before/after you.
</blockquote>

2. Contact your shift partner(s) to alert them you cannot make your shift, and tell them who'll be covering for you.

## Leave of Absence (absence for several weeks or months)

With advance notice, it is possible to find coverage for 4+ weeks of shifts. You will then simply return to your shift, and make up owed shifts over time.

If you will be gone for more than 4 weeks, inform the scheduler that you'll be on a leave of absence. The scheduler will then attempt to place other members on your shift. The more notice you can provide, the better for the co-op.

You will not be *guaranteed* your same shift when you return.

## Leaving the Co-op
 If you decide to leave a working shift, or leave the co-op entirely, a *minimum* of 4 weeks' notice is required. Please contact the scheduler to begin your 4 week notice.

## "Banking" Shifts for Future Time Off
 We don't currently have a system for banking shifts. If you work additional shifts by covering empty slots, and then take a leave of absence, the co-op is still left with empty slots. We depend on people banking time *between* members.
