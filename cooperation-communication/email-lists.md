## Subscribing to Lists

Some of the 4th Street mailing lists are managed using [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/), free and open source software, installed on our server at [May First/People Link](http://www.mayfirst.org/).  
Those lists are managed and/or moderated by the [Information Systems working group](http://4thstreetfoodcoop.org/bin/wiki/foodcoop/view/Info_Sys/WebHome), please [contact them](http://foodcoop.mayfirst.org/contact) with any problems or suggestions.

## General lists
### 4-alerts
The 4-alerts list is for alerts and crucial announcements directly related to coop business. It's also a last resort for arranging shift replacements if phone calls and postings to the 4 list are unsuccessful. This list is very low traffic (generally 1-3 posts weekly) and as such everyone should join it.

### 4-list
The 4 list is for general discussion, including routine Co-op-related discussions. 4-list is a great way to stay current with what's going on within the Co-op, and add your voice to the many issues we discuss, including new/current products, store/membership policy, upcoming promotions/events, store arrangement, membership, and To subscribe
