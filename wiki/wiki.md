## How to Make a Proposal

1. Know where to submit it (either direct to the list, or to a Working Group first)  
* If your proposal overlaps with the responsibilities of a working group, send it to the group before posting to the list. They may be able to take action on it themselves; otherwise they'll ask you to present it to the General Membership.
* If the proposal doesn't fit with any particular working group, or if a you feel the WG hasn't given your idea a fair hearing, you can present it to the General Membership yourself by posting it on the list.

2. Write a clear and thorough proposal.  
* Provide all the relevant info in your writeup (rationale, details, cost/revenue projections, help needed, timeline, etc).
* Make sure each option that needs to be voted on is presented clearly.
* If you want the co-op to authorize spending, include a budget.
* If you have not begun to do research, your proposal should include questions you'd like answered before you can begin.

3. Post and present it.  
* Send it to the discussion list, (not Alerts), and
* Post a printed copy in the store, both by the deadline (store closing, 8 days prior to meeting)
* Bring 6 copies to the meeting for people to read, and be ready to answer questions. If copies are not brought, the proposal will not come to a vote.

## Tips for an Awesome Proposal

* Consider the total effect of your proposal. The devil is in the details.
Keep it as concise as is possible.
* If your proposal is not a straight up/down vote, but contains options, submit your votes prior to the meeting.
Send rough copies, or even just a summary of your idea to working groups, admin, the discussion list, or long-term members. Feedback and discussion prior to voting makes for more efficient meetings, and better proposals.
